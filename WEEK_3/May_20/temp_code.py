The trial division method is generally easier to understand for beginners.\n* For larger ranges, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is considerably more efficient. Choose the Sieve method whenever you need to find primes in a large range (e.g., up to 1 million).\n\n\nBoth examples produce the same output: the list of prime numbers between 1 and 100.
