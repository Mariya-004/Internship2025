Chunking

Chunnking is a process of breaking down complex information into smaller, more manageable pieces or "chunks." This technique is often used in 
various fields, including education, cognitive psychology, and data processing, to improve understanding and retention of information. 
By organizing information into smaller units, individuals can better comprehend and remember the material. 
In the context of AI and prompt engineering, chunking refers to the practice of dividing a large prompt or input into smaller, more focused 
segments.
This can help the AI model process the information more effectively and generate more relevant responses.

Chunking can be applied in various ways, such as:

1. Breaking down complex questions: Instead of asking a broad or complicated question, break it into smaller, more specific questions that the 
AI can address one at a time.
Example
- Instead of asking "What are the causes and effects of climate change?" you might ask "What are the main causes of climate change?" followed 
by "What are the effects of climate change on the environment?"

2. Dividing long texts: If you have a lengthy passage or document, consider breaking it into smaller sections or paragraphs. This can help the AI
model focus on specific parts of the text and provide more accurate summaries or analyses.
Example
- Instead of providing a long article in one go, you might break it into sections and ask the AI to summarize each section individually.

3. Using bullet points or lists: When presenting information, consider using bullet points or numbered lists to organize the content. 
This can make it easier for the AI model to process and understand the information.
Example
- Instead of writing a long paragraph about the benefits of exercise, you might create a list of bullet points highlighting each benefit.

4. Providing context in chunks: When asking the AI to generate a response, consider providing context or background information in smaller chunks.
This can help the AI model better understand the context and generate more relevant responses.
Example
- Instead of providing a long background on a historical event, you might break it into smaller sections, such as the causes, key figures, and
  consequences, and ask the AI to address each section separately.
