Vector Database

A vector database is a special kind of database designed to store, manage and search vector embeddings effectively. Vector embeddigs are high dimensional
representations of datas like: text, images, audio or video produced by ML models, particularly deep learning models.

Key concepts:

1.Vector Embedding: numerical representations(vectors) that capture the semantic features or meaning of data.
2.Similarity Search: instead of traditional keyword-based search, vector databases use similarity search to find the most relevant vectors based on distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.
3.High Dimensional Space: vector embeddings are often high dimensional (hundreds or thousands of dimensions), making traditional indexing methods ineffective.
4.Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN): many vector databases use ANN algorithms to speed up the search process by approximating the nearest neighbors instead of calculating exact distances.


Use Cases:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): vector databases are used to store word embeddings, sentence embeddings, and document embeddings for tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems, and chatbots.
2. Image and Video Retrieval: vector databases can store image and video embeddings for tasks like content-based image retrieval, facial recognition, and video analysis.
3. Audio Analysis: vector databases can store audio embeddings for tasks like speech recognition, music recommendation, and sound classification.
4. Recommendation Systems: vector databases can store user and item embeddings for personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
5. Anomaly Detection: vector databases can store embeddings of normal and anomalous data for tasks like fraud detection, network security, and fault detection.
6. Drug Discovery: vector databases can store molecular embeddings for tasks like drug discovery, protein folding, and genomics.

Examples of Vector Databases:

1. Pinecone: a managed vector database service that provides fast and scalable similarity search for machine learning applications.
2. Weaviate: an open-source vector database that provides a GraphQL interface for semantic search and knowledge graph applications.
3. Milvus: an open-source vector database designed for high-performance similarity search and analytics on large-scale data.
4. Faiss: a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, developed by Facebook AI Research.
5. Annoy: a C++ library with Python bindings for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces, developed by Spotify.
6. Qdrant: an open-source vector search engine that provides a RESTful API for similarity search and analytics on large-scale data.
7. Chroma: an open-source vector database designed for fast and efficient similarity search on large-scale data.
